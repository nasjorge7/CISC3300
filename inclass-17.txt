CISC 3300 SP25 
In class assignment 17 
1. MYSQL is a relational database program (one of many) that uses SQL queries. It is the flavor of SQL we will be using. 
2. A relational database uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database, these are called relationships. 
3. normalization avoids data duplication by using relationships 
4. We can query our tables for result sets of our data with the SELECT statement 
5. Create a new database called cisc3300(which I would use for the rest of the course), create a new table for your fictitious company or your final project, insert some data, send a screenshot of a query returning that output.
