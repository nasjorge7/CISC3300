Homework 2 
1. What do the id and class attributes do? How are they alike and different? 
The ID attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element, whereas the class attribute specifies the class of an HTML element. They are similar in that both can be used to refer to an id/class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by JavaScript to access and manipulate items with the specified id/class. The difference is that id is used to uniquely identify an element, whereas class is used to style or manage numerous items in the same manner. 

2. What are the parts of a CSS rule?
